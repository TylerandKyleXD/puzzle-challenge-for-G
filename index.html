    <h1>Hello, Traveler.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>You know why you are here.</p><br>
    <p>You will be put through a puzzle that involves cryptography, problem solving, and probably other things.</p><br>
    <p>If you manage to solve all 10 levels, I will really begin to watch One Piece (IF you are the person who knows the correlation between silver and green If you aren't, then have fun.)</p><br>
    <p>Now, One Piece is known to be ridiculously long. Therefore, I am not going to be making these levels easy.</p><br>
    <p>You will seldom recieve my help, though I <i>might</i> put hints along the way. Maybe.</p><br>
    <p>Anyway, to prove that you are worthy enough, solve this entrance puzzle.</p><br>
